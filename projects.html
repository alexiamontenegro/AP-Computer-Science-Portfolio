    <h1><center> Welcome to Alexia's Portfolio!</center></h1>
    <p><center> My Scratch Story project will be shown here!</center></p> 
    <p><center>The purpose of my story is for the user to be interactive within it. It is a an interactive story that allows the user to chose their own ending. Throughout the story the use is also able to interact with certain objects or characters that move the storyline along. For the development of this progrma Scratch was used and also made by myself and a partner. During the creation of this program the understanding of algorithms was learned and how to use "backlogs". Backlogs are used to keep track of user testing and reminders of what need to be finished in the product.</center></p>

     <p><center> My App Project Will be shown here! </center></p>
     <p><center> The purpose of my this project was to create an app that would help people's lives. With this project I worked with a partner and created an Activity Generator. The Activity Generator was designed to for people who are bored and don't know what to do, find something to do! The app begins by giving a choice of whether the activity the user wants to do is by themselves, with friends, in the morning, at night, indoor, or outdoor. After the user decides, the Activity Generator will generate an activity. If the user does not like the activity they can regenerate and another activity will show up. If they do like the activity that was given they can select "will do" that will transfer the activity to a list of all the activities they have done. The users can view the list at a later time. While making this app, I was able to learn a new way of coding and how to debug my program.</center></p>

    <p><center> My Python Game Project will be shown here!</center></p>
    <p><center>The purpose of this program was to create a game using python. My partner and I created a dice game called Pig. This game is a two player where each player takes a turn rolling a die, and thie first person to reach a total of 100 wins. The game has cool exceptions that everytime a user rolls a one they must switch turns. Also, after every turn, the users can decide if they want to give their turn to the following player. I learned how creat shorter codes to make the process of debugging eaiser through the process.</center></p>

    <p><center> My Modifying a Simulation project will be shown here!</center></p>
    <p><center> The purpose of this project was to edit a simulation. The edit could be anything from adding a new characyer to changing the data sets. In my modification, my partner and I modified a simulation that showed the population of sheep and wolves and also how their food decreases. We modified the simulation by adding a secon predator. This modification cause for the population of sheep and wolves to decrease quickly. Eventually the predator that was added died off because it no longer had any more to feed off on. So that left for the grass or the food to continue to increase which led to a surplus of fod because there were no longer and animals to eat it.</center></p>

    <p><center> My Big Data Computational Innovation Project will be shown here! </center></p>
    <p><center> The purpose of this project was to create any sort of artifact that helped explaing the concept of your innovation. For my innovation I chose an AI powered sales associate. This sa;es associate has the power to act like any human like associate. In order to explain this I uses Canva.com to help my make an inforgraphic to display my information. While also using an inforgraphic maker, I had the help of the internet to search for data and facts about my artifact. This project was helpful in preparation of the AP computer Science Exam. The exam had us do an identical project with identical task and questions, except choosing a separate artifact.</center></p>

  <p><center> My Create performance Task will be shown here! </center></p>
  <p><center> The purpose of the create performance task was to prepare for the AP Computer Science Exam. Making this task allowed for us to complete out AP College Board Portfolio for the exam. In order to prepare for this portfolio we had 20 hours in class to creat this portfolio. In the mist of completing the creat task I was able to learn alot moe from this class on my own as well. Since there was no help from our teacher druing these hours alot of thew okd was doen with no help or assistance therefore I was able to teach my self a vaious amount of thing about computer sciene alone.

  <p><center> My Explore Performance Task will be shown here! </center></p>
  <p><center> The purpose of the create performance task was to prepare for the AP Computer Science Exam. By investigating a new piece of tchnology and its programming, I was able to make an infographnic with all its necassary information using Canva. This prepared be for the exam by becoming familiar with my piece of technology. I was able to answer the questions well enough to prepare for the exam itself. The artifact that I chose was an Amazon Alexa that is able to help users that are on the go every day. </center></p>
